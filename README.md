Make all of the Minecraft Forge mods publish MCStats statistics!

/*
* TODO: Find out what happens when this is run when mods already implement Plugin-Metrics (BoatCraft, dynmap, ForgeEssentials)
* I'm hoping that Plugin-Metrics will handle the second time the mod activates metrics and not push double statistics.
